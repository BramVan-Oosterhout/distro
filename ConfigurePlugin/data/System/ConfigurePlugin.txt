---+!! Configure Plugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

This plugin provides access to all %WIKITOOLNAME% configuration data through
the webserver, supports running server-side checkers and wizards, and
allows you to save modifications.

You do not have to have this plugin installed to run %WIKITOOLNAME%. Checkers
and wizards can be run from the command-line using the =tools/configure_test=
script, and !LocalSite.cfg can be manually edited to add your required settings.
However this UI provides a simple way to access the configuration without
requiring login access to the server.

If your system has an existing !LocalSite.cfg, then you *must* be
logged in to %WIKITOOLNAME% as an administrator, or as a user identified by the 
={FeatureAccess}{Configure}= parameter before attempting to use
this interface. If no !LocalSite.cfg exists, then you will automatically
logged in as an admin.  Do not log out of Foswiki until you have done one of
the following:
   * Registered a user and added them to the AdminGroup
   * Registered a user and added them to the ={FeatureAccess}{Configure}= list of users
   * Added =BaseUserMapping_333 to ={FeatureAccess}{Configure}= and set a super user password in the expert setting ={Password}=

Users of the =configure= interface access it through the CGI script in
=bin/configure=. The UI is self-explanatory and needs no further introduction
here.

Of interest to developers may be the JSON RPC interface provided by the
plugin, which gives access to the Foswiki configuration to web clients
(who must, of course, meet the above criteria to make RPC calls).
