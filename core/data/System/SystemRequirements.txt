---+ System Requirements

Low client and server base requirements are core features that keep Foswiki widely deployable, particularly across a range of browser platforms and versions. Many extensions exist which enhance and expand Foswiki's capabilities; they may have additional requirements.

%STARTINCLUDE%
---++ Server Requirements

Foswiki is written in Perl 5, which is supported on Microsoft Windows as well as Unix and Unix-like systems (including Linux and OSX).  On Unix-like systems, it uses a number of shell commands. It should be able to run out-of-the-box on any server platform that meets the following requirements.

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Resource* | *Required Server Environment* |
| Perl | 5.8.8 or higher. |
| External programs | GNU =diff= 2.7 or higher, =fgrep=, and =egrep= (not required on Windows) |
| Web server | Apache, Nginx and Lighttpd are all well supported; Apache sample configs are provided. For information on other servers, see Foswiki:Support.InstallingOnSpecificPlatforms. |
Foswiki is designed to automatically detect the platform and generate a basic configuration the first time the =configure= script is run, but start from your expected default "view" URL, so that Foswiki can figure out your URL scheme.

Use either the =bin/configure= web interface, or the =tools/configure= perl script, to configure Foswiki. This will explore and test critical dependencies and alert you when any are missing. For a detailed report, [[PerlDependencyReport][See PerlDependencyReport]].

The following dependencies are usually met by the Perl core installation: =Carp=, =CGI= (=CGI= has been removed from recent Perl versions), =Config=, =Cwd=, =Exporter=, =File::Basename=, =File::Glob=, =FileHandle=, =File::Path=, =File::Spec=, =File::Temp=, =IO::File=, =MIME::Base64=, =POSIX=, =Socket= and =UNIVERSAL=.

Prior versions of Foswiki shipped with the important CPAN modules, for use as a "last resort". Since they are needed only in rare situations,
they were put into an optional extension. See Foswiki:Extensions.CpanContrib. Install this extension into your Foswiki installation directory if you cannot install Perl modules otherwise.

You can check the dependencies before Foswiki is fully operational with the following command.  It will list all potentially missing dependencies.  Not all listed dependences are required on all installations, Refer to the usage message that accompanies each missing dependency in the report.

<verbatim>
cd /path/to/foswiki

Apache user should issue the following commands:
   $ =a2enmod cgi=: Enables CGI
   $ =a2enmod access_compat=: Apache 2.4: Enables compatibility with foswiki example apache configurations.

#ClientRequirements
---++ Client Requirements

The [[InstallationGuide][standard installation]] has relatively low browser requirements:

   * XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant
   * Cookies, if persistent sessions are required
   * Javascript, is required for configure, edit save and upload functionality.  Foswiki is viewable without javascript.

CSS and Javascript are used in most skins. Some skins will require more recent releases of browsers. The default (Pattern) skin is tested on IE 6+, Safari, Chrome and Firefox.

You can easily select a balance of browser capability versus look and feel. Try the installed skins at %SYSTEMWEB%.SkinBrowser and more at Foswiki:Extensions.SkinPackage.
