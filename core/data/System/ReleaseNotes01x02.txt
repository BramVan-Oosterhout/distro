---++ Foswiki - The Free and Open Source Wiki

Foswiki is an enterprise collaboration and information sharing tool targeted for professional use in many types of organizations: from small businesses to multi-nationals, from one-product open source groups, to worldwide research networks.

Foswiki is a wiki: fundamentally, a website with editable web pages. It looks like a normal web site but it encourages contributions, edits, updates, questions, and answers from its users. It's a powerful way of enabling a community to communicate asynchronously using intranet and public internet websites. Foswiki is simple to learn and use. It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web and eliminates the one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content.

Foswiki is a structured wiki with tools that enable users without programming skills to build powerful yet simple applications to process information and support workflows. Developers can extend the functionality of Foswiki with plugins.

Foswiki is backwards compatible with content generated on all previous Foswiki versions, and even content and many plugins from TWiki installations (Foswiki 1.2 ships with a !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin, thus enabling most extensions made for TWiki to work in Foswiki. TWiki<sup>&reg;</sup> is a registered trademark of Peter Thoeny.)

Foswiki is released under the GNU General Public License.

#Release01x02Changes
---++ Changes in requirements

<div class='foswikiHelp'>
   * !JavaScript is now required for most operations other than simple page views.
   * Foswiki no longer bundles CPAN modules. See SystemRequirements for details on prerequisite modules. Check dependencies by running  =perl tools/dependencies=
</div>

---++ Deprecation

---+++ Space delimited square bracket links have been removed.
The long-deprecated =[<nop>[http://foswiki.org Spaced title]]= link format has been removed. Links must be written as =[<nop>[url][title]]= format if a title is desired.

---+++ Deprecated =AllowInlineScript= configuration setting removed

The =$Foswiki::cfg{AllowInlineScript}= setting has been removed.  Inline scripts are always allowed.
Extensions like the Foswiki:Extensions.SafeWikiPlugin can be optionally used to control javascript within topics.

---+++ Deprecation of empty DENY rules

The intention to deprecate the use of an empty =DENYTOPIC&lt;action&gt;= rule to act as an "ALLOW all" has been completed.   This has been a
pending change predating Foswiki 1.0.0.

<div class='foswikiHelp'>%X% *ACTION REQUIRED* Any topics in the system that allow access by supplying an empty DENYTOPIC
rule need to be updated.  A utility has been provided to find and convert existing empty DENY rules to the new ALLOW format.
You can choose to defer this action by enabling =$Foswiki::cfg{AccessControlACL}{EnableDeprecatedEmptyDeny}= in the _Security and Authentication_
section under the _Access control_ tab.
</div>

With release 1.2 of Foswiki, a new ACL rule, the asterisk,  is used as a
wildcard to match *any* user, including the guest user, !WikiGuest. Prior to
Foswiki 1.2,  a topic could be made accessible to everyone by coding
an empty =DENYTOPIC&lt;action&gt;= rule.   This rule is no longer active by
default.

A conversion tool is available in the tools directory.  =tools/convertTopicSettings.pl=  It can perform the following actions:
   * Convert empty =DENYTOPIC&lt;action&gt;= rules to the corresponding =ALLOWTOPIC&lt;action&gt;= *=
   * Optionally convert inline ACLs into META settings. This is recommended for Foswiki 1.2
   * Optionally convert __all__ inline settings into META settings.

For additional information run =perl tools/convertTopicSettings.pl -help=

---+++ Deprecation of !PasswordManager =Foswiki::Users::ApacheHtpasswdUser=

This password manager was included primarily as demonstration code and was not
fully functional.  The default =Foswiki::Users::HtPasswdUser=  provides
better functionality and it works.  The modules are compatible and no changes
are needed.

---+++ Deprecation of jQuery plugins
A number of jQuery plugins have been deprecated  and should be disabled in the configuration. Recommended replacements:

   * jquery.corner, direct use of CSS recommended.
   * jquery.gradient, direct use of CSS recommended.
   * jquery.rating replaced by jquery.stars
   * jquery.shake, is now part of jQuery-ui
   * jquery.simplemodal, replaced by ui::dialog, the jQuery ui-dialog widget.
   * jquery.supersubs, superseded by jQuery.superfish
   * jquery.tmpl, replaced with jsrender
   * jquery.tooltip, replaced with the tooltip component of jQuery-ui

---+++ Deprecation of EDITBOXSTYLE and EDITBOXWIDTH settings
These settings are not used with the new NatEditPlugin editor.

With the old wikitext editor, these settings are used only until the user
drags the corner of the edit window.  Once the window size has been changed
with a drag event, the settings are remembered in a cookie and the
preference settings are ignored.

---+++ Deprecation of  =Meta::get/setEmbeddedStoreForm= API

These Meta APIs will be removed in Foswiki 2.0.
They are retained for compatibility only, should not be used in new code,
and should be replaced in existing code.
   * for =Foswiki::Meta::getEmbeddedStoreForm()=, use =Foswiki::Serialise::serialise($meta, 'Embedded')=.
   * for =Foswiki::Meta::setEmbeddedStoreForm()=, use =Foswiki::Serialise::deserialise($text, 'Embedded', $meta)=

<noautolink>
---+++ The EditTablePlugin has been deprecated and removed from the release

The EditTablePlugin has been replaced by the EditRowPlugin. If installed, the EditTablePlugin should be disabled in the configuration.
The old EditTablePlugin is still available for installation from
http://foswiki.org/Extensions/EditTablePlugin, but is not being
maintained.

The EditRowPlugin has significant advantages over the old EditTablePlugin.
Most features of the EditTablePlugin are supported, with the exception of the
=editbutton= parameter, and plugin preferences.

The EditRowPlugin also enhances features previously provided by
the TablePlugin. The EditRowPlugin adds client side javascript based sorting of tables, which has significant performance advantages.

The TablePlugin and EditRowPlugin can be used together, with one exception.
A table statement with the initsort parameter e.g.  =%<nop>TABLE{ initsort="... " ]%=
will cause confusion as the table will be resorted every time a row is opened for
edit, as well as when the whole table is opened for edit.
</noautolink>
---++ Important changes in Foswiki 1.2
---+++ Installation process has changed significantly!
You should not visit 'bin/configure' as your first access.  After extracting
the Foswiki code and preparing your web server:
   * Visit your desired default URL.  If using Short URLs, use the short form: =http://yoursite.com/Main/WebHome=  or =http://yoursite.com/foswik/Main/WebHome=, ...
   * Follow the link in the banner of that initial page to access configure.
   * After saving the configuration, return to your wiki pages, register your initial user and add them to the !AdminGroup.

---+++ Perl libraries and paths

Foswiki no longer ships Perl CPAN libraries for use as a last
resort. If it is not possible or convenient to install perl libraries, then
install the Foswiki:Extensions.CpanContrib to get pre-built libraries
for Foswiki to use.

The setup of the perl =@INC= path has been simplified, and the =foswiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg=
setting for =$CPANBASE= has been completely eliminated.  A simple method of
adding libraries to the top of the @INC path is provided in the new example
=foswiki/bin/LocalLib.txt= shipped with foswiki.

<div class='foswikiHelp'>%X% *ACTION REQUIRED* If you are upgrading an existing system and
have created a custom =foswiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg=, you should tailor a new
copy using the updated =foswiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt= <sticky>&nbsp;</sticky> (Note that on most systems, =foswiki/bin/LocalLib.txt= is not required.</div>

---+++ Authentication, Authorization and Security

Users now have the option to authenticate via 'TemplateLogin' using their email address. This feature is optional, and is enabled in the _Security and Authentication_ section, _Login_ tab of configure. Enable ={TemplateLogin}{AllowLoginUsingEmailAddress}=.  If more than one user shares an email address, the user with the matching password will be selected during login.
---++++ REST Script default security has changed:

Foswiki 1.2 has removed the =rest= script from the list of ={AuthScripts}=.  Instead of providing blanket
security for =rest=, each handler is now responsible to set its individual requirements for 3 options:
<i>authentication</i>, _validation_ and <i>http_allow</i>ed methods (POST vs. GET).  The defaults for these
3 options have been changed to default to be secure, and handlers can exempt these checks based upon their specific requirements.

A new configuration option has been added to the _Security and Authentication_ section, _Login_ tab: ={LegacyRESTSecurity}=. Enable this setting to restore the old insecure
defaults for REST handlers.  If enabled, and =rest= is not listed in ={AuthScripts}=, a warning will be displayed.

---++++ New Pluggable Access Control implementations.

Foswiki has made the Access Control implementation "Pluggable".  New ACL
methods may be more easily implemented in the future.  The default method is
=$Foswiki::cfg{AccessControl} = 'Foswiki::Access::TopicACLAccess';=.

Two additional methods are now included which may be of help to the
Administrator:
   $ =AdminOnlyAccess=: When selected, all requests for access are denied except when requested by users in the !AdminGroup.
   $ =TopicACLReadOnlyAccess=: The topic ACLs are applied as usual, but any access other than VIEW access is denied, except for users in the !AdminGroup

<div class='foswikiHelp'>%X% *Caution:* These controls are enforced at
the ACL Level.  Extensions have the ability to ignore access controls.  If an
extension fails to check for access permission, then these new methods will
not block access.
</div>

---++++ CGI Related changes
---+++++ Session ID Security improvements.

In Foswiki 1.2, sessions ID's will be changed whenever the user identity changes.  This improves the resistance to certain session hijack attacks.
This is not believed to have any negative impact, however there is a race condition if the user uses multiple browser tabs, and authenticates in one
tab while the other tabs are interacting with the server (for ex. a long running attachment upload in one tab, followed by a _internal admin_ login in another tab.
The session ID in use for the upload will be deleted because of the _internal admin_ login and results are unpredictable.

This change is important for security purposes and cannot be disabled.
---+++++ Sessions and Roaming or Mobile Users
In Foswiki 1.2, =$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{UseIPMatching}= has been enabled by default.  This change can improve security by
reducing the exposure to certain session hijack attacks.  However it can be disruptive to mobile users.  It is also of limited use when
users access the wiki through a proxy or other devices that might cause multiple users to share the same IP address.

With =UseIPMatching= enabled,  =CGI::Session= code will compare the current user's IP Address to the address that was used when the session was initially created.
If the IP address has changed, then the session is invalidated and the user is required to re-authenticate.
There is further information about this option in the [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure =Security And Authentication= tab]] interface.

<div class='foswikiHelp'>%X% *ACTION REQUIRED* If you have roaming users who need to keep their Foswiki Sessions across IP Address changes, then
you need to disable the ={Sessions}{UseIPMatching}= option in your configuration.</div>

---+++++ Optional Sessions for Guest users

_EXPERIMENTAL_ feature: In %WIKITOOLNAME% version 1.2, sessions can be suppressed for guest users.   This is believed safe if guests have no ability to update.
However if guests are permitted to update, for example by using the CommentPlugin, or if any wiki applications make use Session Variables, then guest sessions should be enabled. See the
[[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure =Security and Authentication= tab]] interface for more information.

---+++++ Other CGI related changes
<div class='foswikiHelp'>%X% *ACTION REQUIRED* If you have ={Site}{CharSet}= set to utf-8, you must not use CGI versions 4.11-4.13.
With those CGI releases, topic and form data can be corrupted during save.  CGI version 4.14 released 1 April 2015 is recommended.</div>

Also note that with CGI 4.14, there have been come internal changes that might impact non-default or locally written extensions.  If you have locally written
extensions and use the =CGI::= HTML generation functions, you should review the [[https://metacpan.org/pod/CGI][CGI Release Notes]].

---+++ Configure has been given a major restructuring
| *Foswiki is now able to run without a configuration (=LocalSite.cfg=)* After initial installation, just point your browser at the default URL for Foswiki. Foswiki will "bootstrap" itself and provide a link to configure to establish the initial configuration. |

   * Configure is now a conventional "Foswiki Engine" based script. This means that to use configure you *must* be logged in to Foswiki and be in the admin group, or have appropriate permissions granted.
      * You can register an initial user and add them to the !AdminGroup while in "Bootstrap mode" before saving your initial configuration.
   * Configure now requires !JavaScript.
      * Configuration parameters are Checked and saved through AJAX.
      * Configure only transmits changed settings, greatly reducing the required bandwidth and improving performance.
   * Performance
      * !JavaScript minimizes the data transmitted to/from the client. The entire configuration is not sent for each transaction.
---++++ Changes to configure Authentication
   * Configure requires that the user has logged in to Foswiki and either be in the !AdminGroup, or be identified as an authorized configure user.
   * The "admin" superuser password is now optional:
      * If not set, configure depends solely upon the session authentication
      * By not setting, or by clearing the admin password, sites can disable the _internal admin_ login, eliminating sharing of admin passwords, which is considered poor security practice.
   * Configure can be restricted to individual users in or out of the !AdminGroup.
      * If ={FeatureAccess}{Configure}= is NOT configured, then the current user must be in the !AdminGroup in order to view or save the configuration.
      * If ={FeatureAccess}{Configure}= user list is configured, then the current user must be in the list to be allowed access to configure, regardless of whether or not they are in the !AdminGroup.

The Configure access restrictions are also applied to control potentially sensitive
information, such as the new information topics:
   * %SYSTEMWEB%.PerlDependencyReport
   * %SYSTEMWEB%.FoswikiServerInformation

---++++ Configure command line interface

Configure can now be run from the command line using the =foswiki/tools/configure= script. It can be run interactively using =tools/configure -save=  and will prompt for the required minimum configuration options. It can also be run without prompting. Here is an example of a complete Foswiki configuration from the shell, configured for short URLs:
<verbatim>tools/configure -save -noprompt
tools/configure -save -set {Password}='mypassword' -set {DefaultUrlHost}='http://your.site.com' -set {PubUrlPath}='/pub' -set {ScriptUrlPath}='/bin' -set {ScriptUrlPaths}{view}=''  -set {FeatureAccess}{Configure}='JoeUser, FredAdmin' -set {WebMasterEmail}='webmaster@your.site.com</verbatim>

Full help on the available options can be viewed using =tools/configure --help=

---+++ Query Search

The undocumented shortcut notation to reference to a form name is no longer available. Previously you could write:
<verbatim>
%SEARCH{
	type="query"
	"BlogPostForm"
}%</verbatim>

Because this could lead to indeterminate behaviour, the syntax is now more controlled. You now have to refer to the form name:
<verbatim>
%SEARCH{
	type="query"
	"form.name='BlogPostForm'"
}%</verbatim>

---+++ Major change to ICON macro and templates

Foswiki:Development.HtmlAttributesShouldUseSingleQuotes has changed the ICON
macro to generate singe quotes by default.  This has no impact unless the
%ICON macro is being expanded inside a single-quote delimited macro.

In order to simplify migration, a new =quote== parameter has been added to the
ICON macro. =%<nop>ICON{"pdf" quote="\""}%= generates the html using double
quotes delimiters.  See %SYSTEMWEB%.VarICON for more details.

---+++ Major changes to the Foswiki Store subsystem.

The Foswiki Store has been restructured into separate pluggable store implementations.  Foswiki 1.2 ships with two store backends:
   * RCSStoreContrib: This implements the RCSWrap and RCSLite "Revision Control System" based stores, compatible with prior versions of Foswiki and TWiki.
   * PlainFileStoreContrib: A new plain file store that saves topic and attachment as time-stamped copies instead of the "diff" based RCS store. This implementation can use more disk space but is expected to be _much higher performing_ than the RCS store. Existing topics can be migrated to the new store. *Store formats may not be mixed*. One store must be selected.

The utility to migrate between store implementations is =tools/change_store.pl=. Be sure to backup your system before running the conversion. For information on how to run the tool, run:
<verbatim>cd foswiki/tools
perl -I ../lib change_store.pl --help</verbatim>

---+++ New "Natural Editor", !NatEditPlugin replaces the old !WikiText editor
The !NatEditPlugin, a component of the optional !NatSkin, is now the default
WikiText editor.   It is enabled with the new default skin setting:
   * #Set SKIN = natedit,pattern

The NatEditPlugin is a Topic Markup Language (TML) editor, and provides a GUI
"assist" to the user to aid in learning and using TML.  This editor relies
heavily on !JavaScript and jQuery.   Users that must edit without the use of
!JavaScript can override the SKIN setting and remove natedit.

---++ Translation Status

   * Italian translation is 100% complete
   * French and Czech are >99% complete
   * German is >97%
   * Danish is >90%
   * Other languages are 60% complete or lower.
