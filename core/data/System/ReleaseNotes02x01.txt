---++ Foswiki - The Free and Open Source Wiki

Foswiki is an enterprise collaboration and information sharing tool targeted for professional use in many types of organizations: from small businesses to multi-nationals, from one-product open source groups, to worldwide research networks.

Foswiki is a wiki: fundamentally, a website with editable web pages. It looks like a normal web site but it encourages contributions, edits, updates, questions, and answers from its users. It's a powerful way of enabling a community to communicate asynchronously using intranet and public Internet websites. Foswiki is simple to learn and use. It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web and eliminates the one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content.

Foswiki is a structured wiki with tools that enable users without programming skills to build powerful yet simple applications to process information and support workflows. Developers can extend the functionality of Foswiki with plugins.

Foswiki is backwards compatible with content generated on all previous Foswiki versions, and even content and many plugins from TWiki installations (Foswiki ships with a !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin, thus enabling most extensions made for TWiki to work in Foswiki. TWiki<sup>&reg;</sup> is a registered trademark of Peter Thoeny.)

Foswiki is released under the GNU General Public License.

---++ Known issues
For up-to-date information, see [[http://foswiki.org/Support/KnownIssuesOfFoswiki02x01][Known issues of Foswiki 2.1]]

---+++ Use of non-default ={Store}{Encoding}=

*WARNING* About ={Store}{Encoding}=: If you intend to use high-bit characters in attachment filenames (such as umlauts and accents), then links to these
attachments on Foswiki pages *will not work* on a non-utf-8 Store without modification. This is because Foswiki works internally using UNICODE, but the store saves files to disk using your chosen
{Store}{Encoding}. Running the Store with other than =utf-8= encoding is considered a transitional step and not recommended for long-term operation.
The *strongly recommended* solution is to convert your store to UTF8 at the earliest opportunity.

A partial workaround is implemented in the PubLinkFixupPlugin This Plugin will attempt to rewrite broken links.  This _generally_ gets linked images and other attachments working.
However the TinyMCEPlugin is still unable to render image links while editing a topic.

See [[%BUGS%/Item13696][Item13696]] for up-to-date details.

---++ Important changes in Foswiki 2.1

---+++ Deprecations

The !%HTTP% and !%HTTPS% macros are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  These macro now restrict the available information to the
=Accept-language= and =User-Agent= headers.  The list of available headers is now configurable.

---+++ New Perl CPAN dependencies!
<div class="foswikiHelp">
*Foswiki now requires CPAN:Email::MIME*. Foswiki will be unable to send email without this module. SystemRequirements has more details on CPAN dependencies and
package names for most *nix distributions.
</div>

---+++ Enhanced Registraion form

The registration form now accepts the paramater =templatename= to override the default NewUserTemplate.  In addition the registration topics have been
restructured to permit multiple registration pages to be configure, and the customization of the registrration form is greatly simplified.

---+++ Improvements in International Character Set support

Foswiki 2.1 has further improved support for =utf-8= based character sets. Topics and data forms can use utf-8 characters.  They will be properly rendered and
preserved during edit.   The Foswiki core has been fully converted to utf-8 and unicode. All encoding / decoding is done "at the edge", when reading from
/ writing to the Foswiki store.

   * Foswiki 2.1 International support
      * Emails sent by Foswiki now fully support Internation Character Sets.
      * Foswiki now uses NFC Normalization of UNICODE characters. This greatly improves compatibility with Operating Systems like OSX which use NFD form characters by default.
      * Template names are no longer restricted to ASCII characters. 

   * Foswiki 2.0 International support
      * New sites will use utf-8 by default.  Internationalizaiton should just work.
      * Sites migrating data from a previous installation have two choices:
         * Set ={Store}{Encoding} to match the previous ={Site}{CharSet}=. (Default was =iso-8859-1=)
         * Migrate the data to utf-8 by using the =tools/bulk_copy.pl= script. This is the recommended solution.
      * Support for Locales is still known to have issues.  ={UseLocales}= should not be enabled in the configuration.

<div class='foswikiHelp'>%X% *ACTION REQUIRED* If you are upgrading an existing system, you
should review the existing data and determine if migration to utf-8 should be performed.
See the [[%FO%/System.UpgradeGuide][UpgradeGuide]] for more details. Note that the topic and
attachment name filters no longer filter international characters, so migration to utf-8 is
strongly recommended.

Due to the extensive internal changes, extensions may require changes for
compatibility with this release.
   * See [[%FO%/Support.Utf8MigrationConsiderations][Utf8MigrationConsiderations]] for guidance on upgrading local extensions
   * See [[%BUGS%/Item13483][Item13483]] for known extensions compatibility issues.
</div>

---+++ Perl libraries and paths

Foswiki no longer ships Perl CPAN libraries for use as a last resort. If it is not possible or convenient to install perl libraries, then
install the [[%FO%/Extensions.CpanContrib][CpanContrib]] to get pre-built libraries for Foswiki to use.

The setup of the perl =@INC= path has been simplified, and the =foswiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg=
setting for =$CPANBASE= has been completely eliminated.  A simple method of
adding libraries to the top of the @INC path is provided in the new example
=foswiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt= shipped with foswiki.

<div class='foswikiHelp'>%X% *ACTION REQUIRED* If you are upgrading an existing system and
have created a custom =foswiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg=, you should tailor a new
copy using the updated =foswiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt= <sticky>&nbsp;</sticky> (Note that on most systems, =foswiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg= is not required.)</div>

---++ Translation Status

As of this release,
   * Czech, Danish, French, German and Italian are >99% complete.
   * Dutch, Norwegian, and Portuguese (Brazil) are 70-88% complete.
   * Other languages are 60% complete or lower.
   * A new translation has been added: Klingon, 94% translated.

For more details on translation status,  see [[%FO%/Community.TranslationTeam][TranslationTeam]] and [[http://translate.foswiki.org/projects/foswiki][Foswiki's Weblate translation server]].
Foswiki thanks the Translators for their efforts.  If you are interesting in helping with the translation, please contact foswiki-translations@lists.sourceforge.net.
