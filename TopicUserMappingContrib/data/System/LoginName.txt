%MAKETEXT{"A login name is a sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores that
uniquely identifies you to the system. The exact format of the login name will
depend upon how your system is configured.  If your system is not configured
to use login names, then you will log in using your [[[_1].WikiName][WikiName]]." args="%SYSTEMWEB%"}%

%MAKETEXT{"You cannot alter your login name: you have to get the administrator to do this for you."}%

---++ How to Find Yours

%T% %MAKETEXT{"These steps may not be applicable to your system."}%

Look in %USERSWEB%.WikiUsers - if your name is followed by a dash and a word, usually lowercase, this is what you log in with.

e.g.

   * !WikiGuest - guest - 05 Sep 2008

Would mean that !WikiGuest would log in using the login name 'guest'

If, on the other hand, if your entry is like this:

   * !WikiGuest - 05 Sep 2008

Then you would log in using your WikiName, in this case 'WikiGuest'
